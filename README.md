# Vending Machine Simulation

This project simulates a vending machine system using object-oriented programming in C++. It includes classes for managing products, currency, repositories, and a service layer that connects everything. The program provides a command-line interface for user interaction.

## Features
- Add products with a unique code, name, and price
- Add currency (bills and coins) with value and quantity
- View available products and currency
- Purchase a product and receive change if necessary
- Handles input validation and errors

## Project Structure
- **Produs & Bani**: Classes representing products and money
- **Repo & FileRepo**: Generic repository and file-based repository
- **Service**: Business logic for handling transactions
- **Ui**: Command-line interface for user interaction
- **ExcepValidareDate**: Custom exception class for input validation
- **Tests**: Unit tests for core functionalities

## How to Run
Compile and run the project using a C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC). Example:
```sh
 g++ main.cpp -o vending_machine
 ./vending_machine
```

## Testing
Unit tests are included in `tests.cpp`. Run them separately before executing the main program.
